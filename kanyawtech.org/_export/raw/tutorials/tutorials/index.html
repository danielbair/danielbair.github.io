--> Step 1. Install Fonts and a Keyboard Layout^

To view Karen Unicode text you need fonts. While there are several options, Padauk is probably the best. Download it from [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=padauk|scripts.sil.org]]), and install in your computer.

Also, see the [[development:Fonts]] page for additional font faces and discussion.

<WRAP important>There are many reasons for you to use proper Unicode fonts. In the past, due to technical limitations and general ignorance, many people have used non-Unicode Karen (and Burmese) fonts. It's time to let go of the past, and learn to use real Unicode compliant fonts. See the [[Why Unicode]] page for more information.</WRAP>

If you wish to type Karen, you will need a keyboard layout. Download the {{sgaw_karen_knu.zip|KNU keyboard layout}}, and install to your computer. A cheat-sheet is included in that zip archive. Alternatively, visit the development [[development:keyboards]] page for more layouts and discussion.

You'll find directions for installing a Windows keyboard layout on the [[Installing a Keyboard]] page. Information on other layouts and operating system platforms is available on the [[development:Keyboards]] page.
