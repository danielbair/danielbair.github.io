{{ben.jpg?180 }} Hi, my name is Ben. I'm a student, currently studying for a degree in Information Technology. I have spent several years as a volunteer teacher in Thailand and Myanmar, where I had the opportunity to study the Karen language. I maintain this website with the hope that it be useful for Karen people around the world as they interact with modern technology.

Feel free to contact me, I would love to hear from you.
